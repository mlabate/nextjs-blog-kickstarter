A **macaron**, or **French macaroon** is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food colouring.

The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavours that range from traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron#cite_note-5)

There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used, and the related coconut macaroon is often confused with the macaron. In North America, most bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. Stanford professor of linguistics Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history with macaroni (Italian maccheroni, from Greek μακαρία). Jurafsky notes that French words ending with "-on" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with "-oon" (for example: balloon, cartoon, platoon).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron#cite_note-6) In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term "macaroon".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron#cite_note-8)
